# Social_Network_Ad_Placement

This project extracts a small sub-network on a social media site of active users who regularly engage with one another.  In this hypothetical scenario, this data has been given to a marketing company who is tasked with placing ads and special discount vouchers for their client which has several restrictions and contraints specified in the notebook.  The project builds out the visualization of the network and determines critical nodes and edges which relate to the marketing company's objectives.
